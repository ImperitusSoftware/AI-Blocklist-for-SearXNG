# uBlockOrigin Huge AI Blocklist (for SearXNG)
A huge blocklist of manually curated sites (1000+) that contain AI generated content, for the purposes of cleaning SearXNG-based search engines with uBlock Origin.

### Important Read:
This fork has only been tested on uBlock Origin, with priv.au.
If you encounter an issue with another integrated search engine, please open an issue or PR
Cheers :)

If you wish to use uBlacklist or a host file, please refer to the original repository (https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist).

## Installing the blocklist for uBlock Origin
This version of the blocklist has two variants- one for most of the tabs in SearXNG (General, Videos, News, etc), and one for the Image tab exclusively.
These differences exist to account for the fact that the original link of an image is obscured when using SearXNG's image proxy, and so the Image blocklist must instead use the 'Source' element of each image.

### Manual Import

1. Make sure that you have the uBlock Origin Extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), or any browser that supports uBO (& Android via Firefox).

2. Click on the uBlock Origin Extension, and in the bottom right, there is a cog-wheel symbol--named the dashboard. Click it.

3. Once you are in the dashboard, look towards the top. Click on the tab that says "Filter lists".

4. Look towards the bottom, and expand the ```Import``` button.

5. Copy and paste this URL into the dialogue box: 

For general:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImperitusSoftware/AI-Blocklist-for-SearXNG/master/general.txt
```
For images:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImperitusSoftware/AI-Blocklist-for-SearXNG/master/images.txt
```

6. Apply changes, and you're set!

A video guide on how to do this is available as well (which was made for the original AI-Blocklist- most instructions will be the same):

uBlock Origin will automatically refresh the filter list once a day, so you'll always have up-to-date filters. 

If you want to force an update of the filter list, pressing the stopwatch next to the newly added list, then pressing ```Update now``` will achieve that.

## Extension not working as expected??? Try this!
If your newly imported list isn't working, it may be because of an outdated web browsing session. If you're web browser hasn't been closed in a long time, there's a chance the session won't update how it should, meaning importing this list into uBlock Origin or uBlacklist won't work/won't function correctly. 

Try creating a new session, aka closing **all** web browser windows, waiting until all processes are fully closed (4-5 second wait), then re-open your web browser. That should fix it. If that doesn't work, then try clearing your browser's cache.

## Additional list(s)

As of right now, there are four lists. The main general list (for all tabs excluding images) and the main images list (for the images tab only), both of which have an additinal nuclear list.

The nuclear lists have sites that contain a mix of authentic and AI generated imagery (eg. DeviantArt, Artstation, Stock Photography sites, etc), which make it tricky to outright block in the main filter list, so I've designated it to separate lists that you can toggle on and off if you so desire.

### uBlock Origin
In order to use the **Nuclear** lists, do the same steps that you did in the section "Installing the blocklist for uBlock Origin", but instead of using the other url, use:

For general:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImperitusSoftware/AI-Blocklist-for-SearXNG/master/general_nuclear.txt
```
For images:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImperitusSoftware/AI-Blocklist-for-SearXNG/master/images_nuclear.txt
```

## Allowlisting sites
Don't like a website being blocked? You can easily create an allowlist in your own personal uBlock Origin or uBlacklist filter list. 

Here's how to do it. 

### For uBlock Origin:
1. Toggle the [DOM inspector](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/DOM-inspector) `</>` through uBlock Origin's [logger](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger).
2. Locate the URL you want to allowlist.
3. Click on the filter you want to disable (eg. vecteezy.com); it should then be crossed out.
4. Press the save icon, then the "Create" button.

Boom! Now it's allowlisted!

Or, if you don't want to go through that mumbo-jumbo, add this line in your filter list: 

For general:
```
#@#article[class*="result result"]:has(> a:contains("example.com"))
```
For images:
```
#@#article[class*="result result-images category-images"]:has(> a > span[class="source"]:contains("example.com"))
```

Change "example.com" to the URL you want to allowlist. Copy & paste that in uBlock Origin's "My filters" list, and you're set!

## Extended Filtering

It is possible to filter AI results based on keywords. It was originally in the list, but it's been taken out to make it configurable and/or optional (since it is a blanket ruling, and doesn't care about context).

### uBlock Origin
In your personal filter list, you can use this template to add your own keywords you would like to block.

For general:
```
article[class*="result result"]:has(> a:contains("Your Text Here"))
```
For images:
```
article[class*="result result-images category-images"]:has(> a > span[class="source"]:contains("Your Text Here"))
```

Replace "Your Text Here" with your preferred keywords. A short list of **optional** procedural filters that you can use for uBlock Origin are listed below:
